neoPaintingSwitch 1.4
=====================

This plugin uses the same basic idea as located [here](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/inactive-edit-paintingswitch-v0-1-choose-paintings-with-ease-672.5788/) and [here](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/edit-paintingswitch-v0-4-scroll-through-paintings-1185.24604/).

This plugin was originally created by [Edward Hand](http://forums.bukkit.org/members/edward-hand.13332/) (credit to him!) and also eventually updated by [MadMonkeyCo](http://forums.bukkit.org/members/madmonkeyco.22820/). However is was abandoned again and because I use it I needed it working. Basically, it simplifies the selecting of paintings and saves alot of time. Permissions are supported.

Continued support by Hraponssi after being abandoned again. Credit to [Arcwolf](https://bitbucket.org/%7B58981208-0080-4b47-b63b-d176583a1d4a%7D/) , plugin page [here](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/paintingswitch).
